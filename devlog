Moved to yalc instead of yarn link. This helped resolve some weird react hook errors when trying to package a react component in tidyscripts for import into MedKit (voice panel). Also, had to set react as a peerDependency in the web module package.json, but interestingly just installed react and material ui stuff in the parent directory of tiyscripts as usual. I think that during the build step the build/web director is using these modules actually. Hmm...
