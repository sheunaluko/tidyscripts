To Remember: 
- Errors and null values are getting cached -- need to fix this eventually !

Moved to yalc instead of yarn link. This helped resolve some weird react hook errors when trying to package a react component in tidyscripts for import into MedKit (voice panel). Also, had to set react as a peerDependency in the web module package.json, but interestingly just installed react and material ui stuff in the parent directory of tiyscripts as usual. I think that during the build step the build/web director is using these modules actually. Hmm...

Going to implement a caching api into tidyscripts. Will support ttl and eviction strategy (LRU), as well as have a component for inspecting the cache and for

Thought that the API  for creating new store in idb-keyval appears to break when the
"const customStore = new Store('custom-db-name', 'custom-store-name');" 
custom db name uses an underscore!!!  but was WRONG about that-- the problem was the the stores can only be updated when the version is bumped, so I created a new database everytime I wanted to have  new object store instead (see db.ts)

todo: 
[x] Have a more robust api for the event_logger (take it OUT of the hyperloop main function) 
[x] migrate react_dev_app to also use tidyscripts_web package via yalc link 
[x] test the caching status  
[x] remove caching from the NIH herbals library 
[ ] Check that caching is still working  (inspect indexedDB)
