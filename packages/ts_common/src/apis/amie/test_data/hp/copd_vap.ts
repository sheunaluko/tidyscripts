# History and Physical

## Chief Complaint
**Pneumonia**

## One-Liner
A 65-year-old male with a history of COPD and hypertension is admitted with respiratory failure, currently on a ventilator due to suspected pneumonia.

## History of Present Illness
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a significant medical history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and hypertension, who was admitted to the hospital one week ago due to acute respiratory failure. Upon admission, the patient was intubated and placed on a mechanical ventilator. Over the past several days, the patient's respiratory status has shown minimal improvement, prompting further investigation. A chest X-ray revealed diffuse bilateral infiltrates suggestive of pneumonia. Given these findings, the decision was made to start the patient on ceftriaxone for suspected bacterial pneumonia. The patient has been febrile intermittently and has noted an increase in respiratory secretions, which are purulent in appearance. Blood cultures were obtained, and sputum samples were sent for gram stain and culture to identify any infectious organisms.

## Emergency Department Course
On presentation, the patient's vital signs were significant for hypoxia and tachycardia. Initial labs revealed leukocytosis with a WBC count of 14,000/mm³ and an elevated C-reactive protein. Arterial blood gas showed severe hypoxemia. A chest X-ray demonstrated bilateral interstitial infiltrates. The patient was intubated for respiratory failure and started on ceftriaxone. Continuous monitoring of the patient's condition was conducted, with repeat chest imaging and labs every 48 hours to assess for changes in the clinical picture.

## Medications
- **Ceftriaxone** 1g IV every 24 hours  
- **Lisinopril** 10mg PO daily  
- **Albuterol inhaler** 2 puffs every 4 hours as needed  
- **Prednisone** 40mg PO daily  

## Allergies
- **Penicillin** (rash)

## Past Surgical History
- Appendectomy at age 22  
- Right total knee replacement 3 years ago  

## Social History
- Former smoker, quit 10 years ago, 30 pack-year history  
- No illicit drug use  
- Alcohol: occasional, 1-2 drinks per month  
- Lives with spouse in a single-family home  

## Objective Data

### Vital Signs
- **Temperature:** 100.4°F  
- **Heart rate:** 98 bpm  
- **Respiratory rate:** 18 breaths/min (ventilated)  
- **Blood pressure:** 135/85 mmHg  
- **Oxygen saturation:** 94% on ventilator settings of FiO2 40%  

### Physical Exam
- **General:** Sedated and intubated, appearing mildly distressed  
- **Lungs:** Decreased breath sounds bilaterally, rhonchi present  
- **Cardiovascular:** Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs  
- **Abdomen:** Soft, non-tender, no organomegaly  
- **Extremities:** No edema  

### Laboratory/Imaging
- **WBC:** 14,000/mm³  
- **C-reactive protein:** Elevated  
- **Chest X-ray:** Bilateral diffuse infiltrates consistent with pneumonia  
- **Arterial Blood Gas:** pH 7.32, PaCO2 55 mmHg, PaO2 60 mmHg  

## Assessment and Plan

1. **Suspected Bacterial Pneumonia**
   - **Assessment:** Bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray and clinical presentation suggest pneumonia, likely bacterial in origin. Purulent respiratory secretions and recent intubation history further support this diagnosis.
   - **Plan:** Continue ceftriaxone.  

2. **Acute Respiratory Failure**
   - **Assessment:** Respiratory failure necessitated intubation and mechanical ventilation, likely secondary to pneumonia on a background of COPD.
   - **Plan:** Continue ventilatory support with daily ABG checks, titrate FiO2 to maintain adequate oxygenation, pulmonary hygiene, and physiotherapy as tolerated.  

3. **COPD Exacerbation**
   - **Assessment:** Underlying COPD may have been exacerbated by pneumonia, contributing to respiratory failure.
   - **Plan:** Continue bronchodilator therapy, taper prednisone as patient stabilizes, monitor for signs of improvement in lung function.  

4. **Hypertension**
   - **Assessment:** Previously well-controlled on lisinopril. Blood pressure within normal limits currently.
   - **Plan:** Continue lisinopril, monitor blood pressure daily. Adjust anti-hypertensive therapy if necessary.
