# History and Physical

## Chief Complaint
Hyperkalemia and hypertension

## One-liner
A 46-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD) presents with hyperkalemia and hypertension.

## History of Present Illness
The patient is a 46-year-old male with a known history of end-stage renal disease on thrice-weekly hemodialysis who presents to the emergency department with laboratory-confirmed hyperkalemia. He reports that he missed his last dialysis session three days ago due to transportation issues, and since then, he has experienced intermittent palpitations and mild fatigue but denies any chest pain, shortness of breath, muscle weakness, or sensory changes. The patient also reports poorly controlled blood pressure over the past week despite adherence to his home antihypertensive regimen. He denies any recent dietary indiscretions or changes in liquid intake. No recent episodes of fever, cough, or diarrhea. 

## Emergency Department Course
Upon presentation, the patient's vital signs were as follows: blood pressure 178/96 mmHg, heart rate 88 bpm, respiratory rate 18 breaths/min, temperature 98.4°F, and oxygen saturation 96% on room air. Laboratory tests revealed a serum potassium level of 6.8 mmol/L, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) at 60 mg/dL, and creatinine at 9.5 mg/dL, consistent with ESRD. An EKG showed peaked T waves suggestive of hyperkalemia but no arrhythmias were present. The patient was given calcium gluconate 10% intravenously to stabilize cardiac membranes, insulin with dextrose for shifting potassium intracellularly, and received his scheduled dialysis session to remove excess potassium. Additionally, he was given furosemide to aid in the management of blood pressure and hyperkalemia.

## Medications
- Amlodipine 10 mg daily
- Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg daily
- Losartan 50 mg daily

## Allergies
No known drug allergies

## Past Surgical History
None

## Social History
The patient is a former smoker, quitting 5 years ago, and denies any illicit drug use. He occasionally consumes alcohol but denies drinking in the past month. He lives alone in an apartment and relies on public transportation.

## Objective Data
- **Vital Signs:** Blood Pressure: 150/94 mmHg, Heart Rate: 82 bpm, Respiratory Rate: 18 breaths/min, Temperature: 98.4°F, O2 Saturation: 96% on room air.
- **Physical Exam:**
  - **General:** The patient appears alert, oriented, and in no acute distress.
  - **Cardiovascular:** Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
  - **Respiratory:** Breath sounds clear bilaterally, no wheezes, rales, or rhonchi.
  - **Abdomen:** Soft, non-tender, nondistended, normal bowel sounds.
  - **Neurological:** No focal deficits, cranial nerves intact, strength 5/5 in all extremities.
- **Laboratory Results:**
  - Potassium: 6.8 mmol/L (decreased post-HD to 4.9 mmol/L)
  - BUN: 60 mg/dL
  - Creatinine: 9.5 mg/dL
- **EKG Findings:** Peaked T waves, no ST-elevation or arrhythmias.

## Assessment and Plan

1. **Hyperkalemia**
   - **Assessment:** The patient's hyperkalemia is likely due to missed dialysis in the context of ESRD. Initial treatment in the emergency department has been effective in lowering potassium levels.
   - **Plan:** Continue regular dialysis sessions to manage potassium levels. Monitor potassium post-dialysis. Educate the patient on the importance of adherence to dialysis schedule.

2. **Hypertension**
   - **Assessment:** Poorly controlled hypertension, likely exacerbated by volume overload due to missed dialysis. 
   - **Plan:** Continue home antihypertensive regimen including amlodipine, hydrochlorothiazide, and losartan

3. **End-Stage Renal Disease**
   - **Assessment:** Stable ESRD on HD, complications related to missed dialysis.
   - **Plan:** Optimize dialysis schedule adherence. Consider social work referral for transportation assistance or home dialysis evaluation. Regular follow-ups with nephrology.

The patient will be admitted for continuous monitoring and further management of hypertension post-dialysis.
