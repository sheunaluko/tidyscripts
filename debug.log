[ ] Directory Structures
The huge bug I was having stemmed from the fact that I was upgrading typescript and react and react dom inside the root directory but I needed to be doing inside the SUB directory where the error/incompatibility was occuring -- for example in the APP directory itself... 

[ ] MISC
I had to take out the web3 modules because of errors with ethers lib and typescript (they had upgraded from v4 to 6). I can look in github history to find the old source code


[ ] Server Side Rendering
DEBUG HELL. FInally debugged the issue using CHAT GPT => It didnt actually quite figure it out but helped alot. 
Ah, interesting! It sounds like the issue was related to the class definition of SoundEventDetector, which extends window.EventTarget. This extension would indeed attempt to access window immediately during the module's evaluation phase because class inheritance in JavaScript requires the parent class (window.EventTarget in this case) to be resolved when the class is defined, not when an instance is created.

Since window.EventTarget is undefined on the server (where window doesn't exist), this would cause a "window not defined" error as soon as your module is parsed or imported in a server-side context within Next.js.

[ ] Firestore | Wed May 29 20:59:57 CDT 2024 | time => 2 weeks? 
Spent over 1 week trying to figure out why firestore was not working. Turns out it was because I renamed the database to "main" from (default) - and the client libraries try to connect to (default) by default. The error message I was getting from the client library was not helpful and so did not reveal this. I tried many things but finally I tried downgrading firebase library and at first it would not work at all. Then I upgraded to a more recent stable version and --> FINALLY GOT AN ERROR MESSAGE THAT WAS HELPFUL (database with id (default) was not found). THen I knew that it may be how the database was named. Interesting. I then changed the name of the database to (default) and it worked :)  I almost gave up many times on firebase -- i looked into supabase and looked into ATLAS with mongo. WOW. wtf. :/

finished the bugs; here are my thoughts
- implement more slowly; periodically build the web app to check that it still compiles (?automate this)

Noticed that firefox on linux is Google auth not working; but workin on chrome/linux and windows/edge.

Was having an error with the firebase lib
=> NOT WORKING: get_user_collection (there is a problem with resolving the collection reference to an array of documents
   - ?Fix - https://github.com/angular/angularfire/issues/3442 suggests that it may be fixed by downgrading the firebase version, which I could try

=> Turned out that the problem was using firebase imported from tidyscripts_web. By directly importing into the ts_next_app itself; this seemed to resolved the error.
