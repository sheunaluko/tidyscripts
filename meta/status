Currently working on cortex (inside apps/ts_next_app/app/laboratory/cortex_0) 

== CORTEX == 
[x] Implemented matrix
[x] Need to integrate matrix with cortex
[x] -> completed the integration, and upgraded the responses api. however I am getting formatting errors (trying $0 within the string). I want to explore methods to remove this (by using official openai tool call for structure, vs first trying gemini or claude models)
    -> I tried gemini and claude - claude unable to do proper calls. Gemini did amazing and blew me away.
    -> [x] now using gemini and made lots of progress (able to store logs, search logs -- all from ccts generated by cortex as well)

[x ] discovered open source VAD lib based on silero
  -> [x] implementing voice_interface in http://localhost:8000/laboratory/component_viewer
  -> [x] implemented silero 


[x] change status popup to a widget that can be positioned
[x] move audio visualization to center of dashbar 
[x] update html widget (need to trigger automatic re-render, only changing when the full sc
[x] fix background of audio viz (toolbar not responding to dark / light mode and not passing it to  the audio viz




== CORTEX JS EXEC ENV UPGRADE == 
Ok getting lots of bugs - inconsistent functionality.
Want to retain existing architecture //archive it -- and shift to a different model
? DSL for the ai to write DSL code that orchestrates the available functions
--> or for ultimately flexibility -> why not just give it a javascript sandbox (using QuickJS in the browser??)

[x] implemented iframe executation with configurable contex
[x] re-architect cortex to use the JS exec env (sandbox.ts)

Todo:
[ ] add widget that enables paging through JS exec history (see prior code, fn calls)
[ ] need to rearchitect the call chain templates system
[ ] fix the get_user_input function  (also should fire event? to be displayed in UI
[ ] fix the return values of the functions (dont need the @ pattern from the embedding computation anymore
--- 

[ ] when function returns, should ?CAPTURE its value and append it to the function call U

[ ] improve the thoughts UI with a brain emoji to start the line of each thought
[ ] default speed 1.5 



[ ] Also check out PLAYRIGHT MCP server 


== FIREBASE ==

[ ] Migrate firebase functions to newer version and to parameterized env vars (prevents deploy with missing vars)

== RAI == 
Todo:
- now will shift gears to improving the voice and observability interface

- [ ] observability 
- [ ] transfer local storage to LOGIN (or allow user to toggle) ??
      --> seems it would be great to have a lib that supports a unified interface ? 


- [x] EXPAND THE CONDITIONAL LOGIC TO INCLUDE THREE POSIBILITYs, true/false/missing
- [x] before the template is processed, any text including and after  "@END_TEMPLATE" shouuld be discarded 



Completed:
- [x] legend for the dot phrases that shows next to the voice box
- [x]  NEED TO AUTOFORMAT the text box grammatically (use a fast AI model)
- [x] dot phrase should have Title  and Description  (Description shows first) ] (DONT BREAK
EXIStiNG dot phrases)
- [x] alphabetically sort the dot phrases
- [x] CLick on dot phrase to EDIT it (remove the edit button)
- [x] implement RAI
- [x] upgrade RAI -> persistent state on note generator  | after editing the note - if you leave and come back
- [x] get rid of default templates for good
- [x] enter after dot pharse works too


== BUGS ===

In cortex - html display widget enables injection of javascript into page :( 



Possible upgrades 
-> everytime you interact with cortex it keeps a running summary of the conversation stored into the database (run in background thread) as well as a summary of the graph updates

-> asynchronous tools that can be checked in on
-> various ways of reducing latency
-> initializing the system in a non blocking way -- or with all blocking calls in parallel
-> potentially exploring changing calling methodology for run_call_chain_template (different model?)

-> [x] try with gemini flash model -> wow works incredibly well
