Currently working on cortex (inside apps/ts_next_app/app/laboratory/cortex_0) 

[x] Implemented matrix
[x] Need to integrate matrix with cortex
[x] -> completed the integration, and upgraded the responses api. however I am getting formatting errors (trying $0 within the string). I want to explore methods to remove this (by using official openai tool call for structure, vs first trying gemini or claude models)
    -> I tried gemini and claude - claude unable to do proper calls. Gemini did amazing and blew me away.
    -> [x] now using gemini and made lots of progress (able to store logs, search logs -- all from ccts generated by cortex as well) 


Todo:
- now will shift gears to improving the voice and observability interface 


Possible upgrades 
-> everytime you interact with cortex it keeps a running summary of the conversation stored into the database (run in background thread) as well as a summary of the graph updates

-> asynchronous tools that can be checked in on
-> various ways of reducing latency
-> initializing the system in a non blocking way -- or with all blocking calls in parallel
-> potentially exploring changing calling methodology for run_call_chain_template (different model?)

-> [ ] try with gemini flash model
