So.

I have got a nice working version of the voice interface module demonstrated
in apps/laboratory/cortex_0

However it draws on source code from various places:

tidyscripts web voice_interface
onnx.ts (and src/ts_vad )
directly

inside app3.tsx as well


The idea is I want to extract the relevant source code and recreate it all in a packaged form as a
component called Tidyscripts Voice Interface (tivi)

There is a laboratory/component_viewer app that i want to component to be built at, with ALL the relevant source code included
with it. The only assumptions to make are that the wasm and onnx files are indeed present at their coded locations

Completely delete the "Interruptible Voice Interface" component that already exists.

Given the implementation is working currently, I want you to focus on collecting the various source files via copying into the com



component folder, and plugging everything together - rather than re-architecting things.
