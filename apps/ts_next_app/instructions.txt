ok heres the sitch

in laboratory/cortex_0 i have a working implementation of my voice module

in laboratory/components/tivi I have a non working implementation

The goal is to provide cancelable text to speech, which needs to use echo cancellation so that the speech itself is not heard but only the user.

This works in cortex but not in tivi.

Both cortex_0 and tivi have an audio power interface. I can see that in cortex the audio power is SILENT while tts is active.
But in tivi it is NOT silent.

What could be causing this?

Come up with a differential of 4 possibilities
