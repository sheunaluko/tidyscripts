This directory defines an interface for performing clinical decision support.

It is structed by a main page cds.tsx which allows selection of multiple widgets which are defined in the widgets directory.

The Autocare.tsx widget renders the main application.

dashboardInfo is a react state variable which contains the information that is rendered to the dashboard.

This is an array of JSON obects where each has the fields, "action", "data", "reasoning" and "caveat".

These are displayed as Cards to the user.


Although the UI is good it is currently not rendering correctly on mobile devices. the following need to be fixed

- the widget selector is compressed and the text runs off of the buttons.
- the checkboxes for actiontype selection do not fit

Please fix these
