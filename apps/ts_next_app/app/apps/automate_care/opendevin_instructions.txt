It is structed by a main page cds.tsx which allows selection of multiple widgets which are defined in the widgets directory.

The Autocare.tsx widget renders the main application.

dashboardInfo is a react state variable which contains the information that is rendered to the dashboard.

This is an array of JSON obects where each has the fields, "action", "data", "reasoning" and "caveat".

These are displayed as Cards to the user.

2) Change the color of the caveat accordion to the same color as its parent card, and put outline arround the accordion in a darker shad of that color
