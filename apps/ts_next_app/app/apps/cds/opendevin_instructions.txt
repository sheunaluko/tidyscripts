The cds directory defines an interface for performing clinical decision support.

It is structed by a main page cds.tsx which allows selection of multiple widgets which are defined in the widgets directory.

The Autocare.tsx widget renders the main application.

dashboardInfo is a react state variable which contains the information that should be rendered to the dashboard.

This is an array of JSON obects where each has the fields, "action", "data", "reasoning" and "caveat".

These are displayed as Cards to the user.



However I want to make some updates to the interface.

1) The cards should be color coded by the Type of action. Make the colors be particular colors of the material ui theme.
2) In the top right of the recommendations section there are four checkboxes to toggle the display of particular types, which are "Medications", "Labs" , "Imaging", "Reasoning". What type the action is is determined by the following:

Any action that contains the word "medication" is a Medication type
Any action that contains the word "lab" is a Lab type
Any action that contains the word "imaging" is a Imaging type
Any action that contains the word "agree" or "reconsider" is a Reasoning type

If none of these match then the type Miscellaneous is given. Miscellaneous is also a checkbox option

DO NOT INSTALL ANY SOFTWARE
DO NOT RUN ANY CODE
