The cds directory defines an interface for performing clinical decision support.

It is structed by a main page cds.tsx which allows selection of multiple widgets which are defined in the widgets directory.

The Autocare.tsx widget renders the main application.

dashboardInfo is a react state variable which contains the information that is rendered to the dashboard.

This is an array of JSON obects where each has the fields, "action", "data", "reasoning" and "caveat".

These are displayed as Cards to the user.


1) An ObjectInspector is used to display the data field for each card. Instead of this, simply display a JSON.stringify version of the data object

2) THere is a Caveat section on each card, which should be moved to inside an Accordion that is on the card with the name "Caveat"
