# Error Reports Directory

This directory contains timestamped JSON error reports generated by the Neo Cortex voice agent.

## Purpose

When the voice agent encounters errors during tool execution or conversation, it uses the `report_error` tool to log detailed debugging information to this directory.

## File Format

Error reports are saved as `error_TIMESTAMP.json` with the following structure:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-01-18T21:54:00.000Z",
  "error_type": "tool_execution_error",
  "tool_name": "search_tidyscripts_codebase",
  "error_message": "Description of what went wrong",
  "context": "Additional context or debugging information",
  "attempted_action": "What the agent was trying to do"
}
```

## Note

Error files are automatically gitignored and not committed to version control.
