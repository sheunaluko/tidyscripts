COMPREHENSIVE TRANSFORMATION SUMMARY: PROGRESS NOTES TO DISCHARGE SUMMARIES
==================================================================================

This document synthesizes the key transformation principles identified across multiple examples (e1-e4) for converting progress notes into discharge summaries. These principles should guide AI prompt development for automated transformation.

CORE TRANSFORMATION DIMENSIONS
==================================================================================

1. TENSE
   - Convert all present tense observations and future planning language to past tense
   - Narrative should describe what WAS DONE during hospitalization, not what IS or WILL BE done
   - Example transformations: "will continue" → "continued", "plan to" → "underwent"

2. NARRATIVE_STYLE
   - Transform from assessment/planning format to retrospective narrative
   - Convert fragmented clinical documentation into cohesive storytelling
   - May include daily updates that need to be collapsed into single narrative
   - Focus on summarizing entire hospitalization rather than ongoing assessment

3. TEMPORAL_FRAMING
   - Change from ongoing assessment/monitoring to completed hospital stay
   - Document final outcomes rather than current status
   - Shift from "monitoring" to "outcomes achieved"

4. SECTION_HEADERS
   - Convert from "Assessment & Plan" subheadings to hashtag-prefixed problem list (#Problem Name)
   - May consolidate related problems under single headers
   - May remove minor/stable problems not requiring discharge documentation

5. ABBREVIATION_USAGE
   - Maintain clinical abbreviations while ensuring readability
   - Expand critical information for clarity when needed
   - Keep standard medical abbreviations (e.g., CT, MRI, s/p)

6. LIST_FORMATTING & BULLET_POINT_REMOVAL
   - Eliminate ALL bullet points, dashes, and list-based formatting
   - Convert all lists into narrative prose paragraphs
   - Remove indentation and hierarchical list structures
   - Integrate all content into flowing paragraph format

7. SENTENCE_INTEGRATION
   - Combine fragmented clinical notes into complete, flowing sentences
   - May need to combine daily updates into coherent narrative
   - Integrate sub-bullets and nested information into prose

8. ACTION_PLANNING_VS_RETROSPECTIVE
   - Convert future-oriented plans to past tense actions taken
   - Transform monitoring plans to outcomes achieved
   - Change "will do, continue, monitor" to "was done, continued, monitored"
   - Document what actually happened, not what was planned

9. CHRONOLOGICAL_REORDERING
   - Reorganize content to follow hospital course chronologically
   - Present from admission → procedures/interventions → discharge
   - Collapse serial daily notes into single chronological narrative
   - Not as ongoing assessment snapshots

10. OUTCOME_DOCUMENTATION
    - Document what happened during stay and final outcomes
    - Document resolution status rather than pending actions
    - Describe completed procedures and their results
    - Focus on endpoints, not ongoing processes

11. PASSIVE_VS_ACTIVE_VOICE
    - Shift to active voice describing patient's hospital course
    - Use active constructions for clinical interventions
    - "Patient underwent" rather than "was undergone"

12. CLINICAL_REASONING_ELABORATION
    - Expand abbreviated clinical reasoning into fuller explanatory sentences
    - Add connecting phrases to link clinical events
    - Maintain clinical detail while creating narrative flow
    - Use transitional language to explain cause and effect

13. FUTURE_PLANS_VS_DISCHARGE_INSTRUCTIONS
    - Convert future monitoring plans to discharge instructions
    - Transform pending plans to discharge medication regimen
    - Specify follow-up recommendations and discharge condition
    - Clearly state what patient should do after discharge

14. PENDING_ITEMS_RESOLUTION
    - Address all pending consultations, tests, and procedures
    - Document completion status and results
    - Resolve "will order", "plan for" statements with outcomes
    - If not completed, use placeholder markers (see below)

15. CONSULTATION_INTEGRATION
    - Convert consultation orders/requests to completed consultations
    - Document what consultants recommended and actions taken
    - Transform "appreciate recs", "c/s" to "was consulted and recommended..."
    - Remove internal team communication language

16. PROCEDURAL_DETAIL_EXPANSION
    - Expand procedural notes with dates, process, and outcomes
    - Include placement, monitoring, and removal for devices/interventions
    - Document completion of procedures like radiation, ERCP, thoracentesis, etc.
    - Specify timeline of procedural events

17. TREATMENT_CONTINUATION_SPECIFICATION
    - Clearly document discharge medication regimen
    - Replace "continue" with explicit medication on discharge
    - Specify what was held vs. continued vs. changed
    - Avoid vague "cont" or "ctm" statements

18. FOLLOW_UP_DOCUMENTATION
    - Specify follow-up plans rather than ongoing monitoring
    - Document discharge disposition (home, SNF, hospice, etc.)
    - State outpatient follow-up rather than inpatient serial monitoring
    - Include discharge condition

19. REMOVING_ASSESSMENT_PLAN_SUBHEADINGS
    - Eliminate all "Assessment & Plan" repeated subheadings
    - Remove these structural headers from under each problem
    - Integrate content directly under problem headers

20. CONDENSATION_OF_LAB_VALUES
    - Present lab values in narrative form when relevant
    - Integrate into clinical story rather than formatted tables
    - Avoid detailed table formatting in discharge summary
    - Include only values relevant to clinical narrative

21. PRONOUN_USAGE
    - Use consistent pronoun reference throughout (he/his or she/her)
    - Maintain consistency within entire document
    - Patient-specific but ensure uniformity

22. PLACEHOLDER_HANDLING
    - Insert *** markers where actual patient-specific data needs completion
    - Use for pending results that should be filled in
    - Mark incomplete information requiring real patient data
    - Examples: "underwent procedure on ***", "follow up in *** weeks"

23. TRANSITIONAL_PHRASING
    - Add transitional phrases to connect clinical events
    - Create narrative flow between sequential events
    - Use connecting language: "After...", "Following...", "Subsequently..."
    - Link cause and effect relationships

24. REMOVING_INTERNAL_TEAM_COMMUNICATIONS
    - Remove internal team notes and communications
    - Eliminate phrases like:
      - "appreciate oncology recs"
      - "will tbw cardio-oncology Monday"
      - "await serial CXRs and IP recs"
      - "t/b with Med Onc"
    - Convert to completed consultation summaries
    - Document final actions taken, not internal coordination

25. REMOVING_CMS_HCC_ANNOTATIONS
    - Remove ALL administrative coding annotations
    - Strip out: (CMS/HCC), (HCC), (initial encounter), etc.
    - Keep only clean diagnosis names
    - No billing/coding markers in discharge summary

26. COMPLETENESS_OF_INFORMATION
    - Use *** placeholders for information requiring patient-specific completion
    - Mark areas where actual outcomes need to be inserted
    - Ensure all pending items are addressed or marked
    - Final document should be ready for data insertion

27. PROBLEM_LIST_PRUNING (observed in later examples)
    - Remove minor or stable problems not requiring specific discharge documentation
    - Eliminate problems that had no active inpatient management
    - Focus on problems relevant to hospitalization and discharge
    - May consolidate related problems under single headers

==================================================================================
TRANSFORMATION WORKFLOW RECOMMENDATIONS
==================================================================================

For AI prompt development, consider this workflow:

1. STRUCTURAL PASS
   - Remove all "Assessment & Plan" subheadings
   - Convert section headers to hashtag format
   - Remove all bullets, dashes, lists
   - Strip out coding annotations (HCC, etc.)

2. TEMPORAL PASS

   - Change future planning to retrospective narrative
   - Reorder content chronologically

3. CONTENT INTEGRATION PASS
   - Resolve pending items (consultations, procedures, tests)
   - Document outcomes and completion status
   - Expand procedural details with dates and results
   - Insert *** placeholders where data is missing

4. NARRATIVE POLISH PASS
   - Integrate fragmented notes into flowing prose
   - Add transitional phrases
   - Combine sentences and paragraphs
   - Remove internal team communications
   - Ensure consistent pronouns

5. DISCHARGE SPECIFICATION PASS
   - Convert future plans to discharge instructions
   - Specify discharge medications clearly
   - Document discharge disposition
   - State follow-up plans

==================================================================================
SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
==================================================================================

- Serial Daily Notes: Some progress notes contain dated entries (e.g., 12/6, 12/7, 12/8) tracking daily changes. These must be collapsed into a single chronological narrative.

- Multiple Consultations: When multiple specialties are consulted, integrate their recommendations into the narrative with clear attribution.

- Disposition Planning: Progress notes may have ongoing disposition discussions. Discharge summary should document final disposition clearly.

- Incomplete Information: Use *** markers liberally for any information that requires patient-specific data that wasn't in the original note.
