This Christmas I am offering to create you a free AI application! 

I recently was speaking with an infertility specialist about pain points
in her clinical documentation workflow

I offered to create a custom AI powered web application (for free) to solve her problem and
within 48 hours I had the solution pushed to production at tidyscripts.com/apps/rai,
ready for her use.

The application utilizes the cutting-edge OpenAI Realtime Voice API to collect information via voice interaction directly in the browser.
This is then passed to a gemini 3 backend for documentation generation. See the design [here]. 

Through this experience I reinforced my passion and ability to:
1) Understand the pain points of intelligent skilled workers
2) Deliver innovative software solutions rapidly

I am now offering FREE design and implementation of custom AI applications. Yes, I said FREE. 

What is the biggest pain point in your worflow that AI can solve?

Just comment below or DM me with your idea, and if it is feasibile and interesting, I will build and deploy it FOR FREE!
Fully open source, no strings attached, and guaranteed free until AI token costs exceed $500 at which time you can take the code and deploy yourself (I will even help you with that!)  or we can discuss pricing. 

Don't have an idea? Please tag someone you know who might, or like a comment so I can gauge which one to deliver.

My next post will have a link to the final product, so stay tuned! 

Sincerely,
Shay

Before AI agents, code refactoring to improve architecture and remove technical debt was tedious. Now with AI coding tools its as easy as sending a text.

If you are not taking time to refactor and address technical debt you are doing it wrong.
