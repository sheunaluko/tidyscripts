Just below the generate note button I want Microphone icon button next to a text area, with a default text that says generate text to include in your note
It has a copy to clipboard function

This is its own component (the mic and text box)

When the user clicks the mic -- it uses its own custom agent  that is a  transcription agent , that is only designed to relay the user text as a tool
that adds the text to the text area

When the user clicks COPY then the mic is paused, otherwise there are pasue and stop buttons as well.

Any questions?
