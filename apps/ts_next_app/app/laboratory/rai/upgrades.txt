Hello.

I want to upgrade the voice agent to:
- include a thoughts parameter with every tool call
- during inforation input, if advanced features are active then:
  - there is a "Dev tools " widget that appears between the template display and the collected information display

This widget should:
     1) enable sending messages to the realtime agent (using same method that initializes the conversation with user saying Initialize)
     2) Display the agents THOUGHTs with each call
