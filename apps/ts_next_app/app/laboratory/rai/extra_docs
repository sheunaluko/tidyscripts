Option 1 - Accessing the transport layer
If you still want to benefit from all of the capabilities of the RealtimeSession you can access your transport layer through session.transport.

The transport layer will emit every event it receives under the * event and you can send raw events using the sendEvent() method.

import { RealtimeAgent, RealtimeSession } from '@openai/agents/realtime';

const agent = new RealtimeAgent({
  name: 'Greeter',
  instructions: 'Greet the user with cheer and answer questions.',
});

const session = new RealtimeSession(agent, {
  model: 'gpt-realtime',
});

session.transport.on('*', (event) => {
  // JSON parsed version of the event received on the connection
});

// Send any valid event as JSON. For example triggering a new response
session.transport.sendEvent({
  type: 'response.create',
  // ...
});
