Add a Dot Phrase section to template editor , and a Create Dot Phrase button , which laucnhes a Dot Phrase Editor window

A dot phrase is simply a .DOT_PHRASE_TITLE  that when present in the nnote generatation area will be replaced by specified text

Thus the editor should have title (spaces transformed to dash)  and phrase fields.

These get saved locally as well

The validate and transform function on the note generator will detect these when the title occurs (case sensitive) between a period and a space , and replace it with the specified phrase
