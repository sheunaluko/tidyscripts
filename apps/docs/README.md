# Tidyscripts üßòüèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
A documented and clean collection of typescript code for composability and re-use. Created and maintained by Sheun Aluko, MD-MS. 

## About
The holy grail of typescript development lies before you. The Tidyscripts monorepo leverages npm workspaces, vercel and nextjs, and turbo repo to deliver a powerhouse developer experience in a tiny package. At the core is the tidyscripts_common package, which is imported by the tidyscripts_node and tidyscripts_web packages. These, in turn, are imported by the tidyscripts nextjs application, which is deployed on vercel to a global edge computing network. This provides unprecedented full stack typescript library and application development, distribution, and deployment.

Tidyscripts includes libraries for cryptography, functional programming, graphing, financial/cryptocurrency analysis, and much more.
