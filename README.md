## About

The Holy Grail of typescript development lies before you. The Tidyscripts monorepo leverages npm workspaces, vercel and nextjs, and turbo repo to deliver a tremendously powerful and optimized developer experience. At the core is the tidyscripts_common package, which is imported by the tidyscripts_node and tidyscripts_web packages. These, in turn, are imported by the tidyscripts nextjs application, which is deployed on vercel to a global edge computing network. This provides unprecedented full stack typescript library and application development, distribution, and deployment.

Tidyscripts includes libraries for Agentic AI, functional programming, graphing, financial/cryptocurrency analysis, and much more.
