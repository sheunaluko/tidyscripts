react-window is a component library that helps render large lists of data quickly and without the performance problems that often go along with rendering a lot of data. It's used in a lot of places, from React DevTools to the Replay browser.

List
Renders data with many rows.

Required props
Name	Description
rowComponent	
React component responsible for rendering a row.

This component will receive an index and style prop by default. Additionally it will receive prop values passed to rowProps.

ℹ️ The prop types for this component are exported as RowComponentProps

rowCount	
Number of items to be rendered in the list.

rowHeight	
Row height; the following formats are supported:

number of pixels (number)
percentage of the grid's current height (string)
function that returns the row height (in pixels) given an index and cellProps
dynamic row height cache returned by the useDynamicRowHeight hook
⚠️ Dynamic row heights are not as efficient as predetermined sizes. It's recommended to provide your own height values if they can be determined ahead of time.

rowProps	
Additional props to be passed to the row-rendering component. List will automatically re-render rows when values in this object change.

⚠️ This object must not contain ariaAttributes, index, or style props.

Optional props
Name	Description
className	
CSS class name.

style	
Optional CSS properties. The list of rows will fill the height defined by this style.

children	
Additional content to be rendered within the list (above cells). This property can be used to render things like overlays or tooltips.

defaultHeight	
Default height of list for initial render. This value is important for server rendering.

listRef	
Ref used to interact with this component's imperative API.

This API has imperative methods for scrolling and a getter for the outermost DOM element.

ℹ️ The useListRef and useListCallbackRef hooks are exported for convenience use in TypeScript projects.

onResize	
Callback notified when the List's outermost HTMLElement resizes. This may be used to (re)scroll a row into view.

onRowsRendered	
Callback notified when the range of visible rows changes.

overscanCount	
How many additional rows to render outside of the visible area. This can reduce visual flickering near the edges of a list when scrolling.

tagName	
Can be used to override the root HTML element rendered by the List component. The default value is "div", meaning that List renders an HTMLDivElement as its root.

⚠️ In most use cases the default ARIA roles are sufficient and this prop is not needed.

Grid
Renders data with many rows and columns.

ℹ️ Unlike List rows, Grid cell sizes must be known ahead of time. Either static sizes or something that can be derived (from the data in CellProps) without rendering.

Required props
Name	Description
cellComponent	
React component responsible for rendering a cell.

This component will receive an index and style prop by default. Additionally it will receive prop values passed to cellProps.

ℹ️ The prop types for this component are exported as CellComponentProps

cellProps	
Additional props to be passed to the cell-rendering component. Grid will automatically re-render cells when values in this object change.

⚠️ This object must not contain ariaAttributes, columnIndex, rowIndex, or style props.

columnCount	
Number of columns to be rendered in the grid.

columnWidth	
Column width; the following formats are supported:

number of pixels (number)
percentage of the grid's current width (string)
function that returns the column width (in pixels) given an index and cellProps
rowCount	
Number of rows to be rendered in the grid.

rowHeight	
Row height; the following formats are supported:

number of pixels (number)
percentage of the grid's current height (string)
function that returns the row height (in pixels) given an index and cellProps
Optional props
Name	Description
className	
CSS class name.

dir	
Indicates the directionality of grid cells.

ℹ️ See HTML dir global attribute for more information.

style	
Optional CSS properties. The grid of cells will fill the height and width defined by this style.

children	
Additional content to be rendered within the grid (above cells). This property can be used to render things like overlays or tooltips.

defaultHeight	
Default height of grid for initial render. This value is important for server rendering.

defaultWidth	
Default width of grid for initial render. This value is important for server rendering.

gridRef	
Imperative Grid API.

ℹ️ The useGridRef and useGridCallbackRef hooks are exported for convenience use in TypeScript projects.

onCellsRendered	
Callback notified when the range of rendered cells changes.

onResize	
Callback notified when the Grid's outermost HTMLElement resizes. This may be used to (re)scroll a cell into view.

overscanCount	
How many additional rows/columns to render outside of the visible area. This can reduce visual flickering near the edges of a grid when scrolling.

tagName	
Can be used to override the root HTML element rendered by the List component. The default value is "div", meaning that List renders an HTMLDivElement as its root.

⚠️ In most use cases the default ARIA roles are sufficient and this prop is not needed.
